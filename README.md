## Introduction

Cerebral venous oxygenation (Yv) is a key parameter for the brainâ€™s oxygen utilization and has been suggested to be a valuable biomarker in various brain diseases including hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy in neonates and Alzheimer's disease in older adults. T2-Relaxation-Under-Spin-Tagging (TRUST) MRI is a widely used technique to measure global Yv level and has been validated against gold-standard PET. However, subject motion during TRUST MRI scan can introduce considerable errors in Yv quantification, especially for noncompliant subjects. Therefore, we have developed an Automatic Rejection based on Tissue Signal (ARTS) algorithm to identify motion-contaminated TRUST images and exclude them from Yv quantification.
